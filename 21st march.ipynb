    "**Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Ordinal encoding is a type of encoding where categorical values\n",
    "are assigned unique integers based on their order or rank.\n",
    "- **Example:** If you have a categorical variable representing education levels\n",
    "with values \"High School,\" \"College,\" and \"Master's,\"\n",
    "you might assign labels like 1, 2, and 3 based on their ordinal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Encoding:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Label encoding is a more general term and can be applied to both\n",
    "ordinal and nominal categorical variables. In the context of ordinal data, it refers\n",
    "to assigning numerical labels based on order.\n",
    "- **Example:** Using label encoding to represent the days of the week as 1 (Monday), 2 (Tuesday), ..., 7 \n",
    "(Sunday), considering the inherent order of days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "1. **Nature of Data:**\n",
    "   - **Ordinal Encoding:** Specifically designed for ordinal data with a meaningful order.\n",
    "   - **Label Encoding:** More general and can be applied to both ordinal and nominal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Numerical Representation:**\n",
    "   - **Ordinal Encoding:** The assigned numerical values have a meaningful order,\n",
    "    reflecting the inherent hierarchy or rank.\n",
    "   - **Label Encoding:** It can be applied without considering the order, \n",
    "but it often implies an ordinal relationship when applied to ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Application to Nominal Data:**\n",
    "   - **Ordinal Encoding:** Typically not suitable for nominal data without a clear order.\n",
    "   - **Label Encoding:** Can be used for nominal data but may not capture the lack of order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "- **When to Choose Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
    "  - **Scenario:** You have a dataset with a feature representing customer \n",
    "    satisfaction levels with values \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High,\" where there's a clear order.\n",
    "  - **Choice:** Use ordinal encoding to represent the levels as 1, 2, and 3, \n",
    "capturing the ordinal relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When to Choose Label Encoding:**\n",
    "  - **Scenario:** You have a dataset with a feature representing colors, and \n",
    "    you want to use numerical labels.\n",
    "  - **Choice:** Use label encoding, as colors may not have an inherent order, \n",
    "and label encoding provides a numerical representation without implying a specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, choose ordinal encoding when the data has a meaningful order, and \n",
    "choose label encoding for both ordinal and nominal data when a simple numerical representation is needed."
